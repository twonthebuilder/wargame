# AGENTS.md for Wargame

This file provides Codex with a complete understanding of how to interact with the Wargame project. Codex should use this document as its operating manual for building features, fixing bugs, and maintaining a coherent structure.

## General Guidelines

- **Code Style:** Adhere to the project's ESLint and Prettier configurations.
- **Documentation:** All public functions, classes, and components require detailed comments.
- **Testing:** New features and bug fixes must include corresponding unit and integration tests.
- **Commit Messages:** Follow Conventional Commits specification.

## Testing Instructions

- Ensure **all** tests pass before merging branches.
- Ensure tests **actually do something** (not just placeholders that automatically pass)

## Documentation and Observability

- Codex should prioritize **clarity of system behavior.**
- All non-trivial features must be accompanied by in-code comments or API-accessible diagnostics that explain their purpose and behavior.
- When creating new systems, include a brief description of their logic and thresholds, especially if tied to gameplay feedback (e.g. timekeeper, mandate triggers, adjacency modifiers), **and create an accompanying doc file in `/docs/`.**

## Branches

- Most iteration will be done on the `moonshots` branch.
- The `main` branch is the main, stable version that `moonshots` (if they work) eventually merges with.
- The `main(backup)` (if it exists) is usually a version 1-2 updates before `main` branch to isolate and fix any lingering bugs.
- The `OGmain` is a nuclear-level backup containing nothing. (Back to the very beginning, just in case.)
- That's my personal naming convention, if those files don't exist yet, you're just early. Any new branches will be documented as/if they come.

## Final Principles

- Stick to the `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` files, and ultimately its vision and end goals.
- Always explain fixes in plain English unless explicitly told not too.
